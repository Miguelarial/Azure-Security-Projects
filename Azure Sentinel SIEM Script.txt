Azure Sentinel SIEM Script

Description:
This script is designed to extract detailed logs related to failed RDP attempts and gather geolocation data. Additionally, the script aids in the creation of a map in Azure Sentinel to visually represent these RDP attempt origins based on geolocation data.

Script:

FAILED_RDP_WITH_GEO_CL
| extend username = extract@"username:([^,]+)", 1, RawData),
timestamp = extract@"timestamp:([^,]+)", 1, RawData),
latitude = extract@"latitude:([^I+)", 1, RawData),
longitude = extract@"longitude: ([^,]+)", 1, RawData),
sourcehost = extract(@"sourcehost:([^]+)", 1, RawData),
state = extract(@"state:([^]+)", 1, RawData),
label = extract(@"label:([^]+)", 1, RawData),
destination = extract (@"destinationhost: ([^]+)", 1, RawData),
country = extract (@"country:([^]+)", 1, RawData)
| where destination != "samplehost"
where sourcehost!= ""
| summarize event_count=count() by latitude, longitude, sourcehost, label, destination, country

Usage:
1. Extracting Logs: Run the script to gather and process detailed logs related to failed RDP attempts.
2. Creating a Map in Azure Sentinel: Use the script to retrieve and format geolocation data suitable for creating a map in Azure Sentinel to visualize RDP attempt origins.

Note:
Ensure that all necessary configurations and permissions are in place before running this script. Adjustments might be required based on specific Azure Sentinel versions and configurations.
